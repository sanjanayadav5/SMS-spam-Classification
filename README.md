# SMS-spam-Classification using NLP

Project Title:  SMS Spam Classification using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Description:
The SMS Spam Classification project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of automatically identifying and filtering out spam messages from legitimate ones in SMS communications. Leveraging advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project addresses the growing concern of unwanted messages that users receive on their mobile devices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are some key highlights of project:

1. Dataset Preparation:<br>
Gather a diverse dataset containing labeled examples of both spam and non-spam SMS messages.
Preprocess the data by cleaning and tokenizing the text, handling imbalances, and extracting relevant features.<br>

2. EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis): <br>processing of SMS data to handle noise, missing values, and ensure optimal feature extraction.

3. Feature Engineering:<br> Utilized NLP techniques to convert raw text data into meaningful features, capturing the essence of both spam and ham messages.<br>
   Vectorization (Convert Text data into the Vector):<br>
        A. Bag Of Words (CountVectorizer)<br>
        B. TF-IDF :Implement techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to capture the importance of words in the corpus.<br>
        C. Tokenization<br>
        D. Lower Case<br>
        E. Stopwords <br>
        F. Lemmatization / Stemming<br>
				
 4. Model Selection:<br>
Explored various machine learning algorithms such as KNeighborsClassifier, MultinomialNB, DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression to identify the most effective solution for SMS spam classification.Explore and experiment with various ML algorithms suitable for text classification, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.<br>

5. Model Evalution:<br> model parameters to enhance performance, accuracy, and the ability to generalize to new, unseen data.<br>
        A. Accuracy Score<br>
        B. Confusion Matrix<br>
        C. Classification Report<br>
				
6. Model Deployment: using Streamlit<br>
7. Prediction on Client Data/User Data<br>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benefits:<br>
-Empowers users to have a cleaner and safer SMS experience by reducing the impact of spam messages.<br>
-Enhances user privacy and security by filtering out potentially harmful or malicious content.<br>
-Provides a scalable and adaptable solution to combat evolving spamming tactics.<br>
-This project aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts in creating a more secure and enjoyable mobile communication experience for users.<br>
